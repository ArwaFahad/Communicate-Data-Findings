## Dataset

> The data consists of information regarding 520,000 round-cut diamonds, including
bike_id, member_gender, user_type, duration_sec, and other features. The dataset can be found in [here](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data).


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between both  (male gender and weekdays) and the number of rides, so that most rides are ridden by male and was in weekdays. Also we notice that people mostly tend to take a trip in 8am and 5pm.
Also we found out that between august and december -especially in october- the trips duration increase. 
we found also that subscriber user, tend to take less than 2000 second on the trip duration, in other hand customer mostly take more than that. Also we see a strong relation between early morning hours and long duration trips. <br>

> Outside of the main variables of interest, we found out that the relation between customer and number of rides is too strong relation that keep increasing each month till october it reach the peak then decrese, unlike the relation between customer and number of rides which is week relation that keep slowly increasing till september then decrease.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of the three characterizes - gender, days of the week and hours of the day-  on the number of rides on 2017.
